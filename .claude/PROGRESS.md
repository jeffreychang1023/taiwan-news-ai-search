# Progress Log - ML Search Enhancement Project

## Recent Milestones

### 2025-01-26: XGBoost Phase A Started 🔄

**XGBoost Infrastructure Preparation (Week 3-4)**

Started implementation of XGBoost ML ranking system:

1. **Documentation** (complete)
   - Created `algo/XGBoost_implementation.md` (500+ lines)
   - Updated `algo/Week4_ML_Enhancements.md` with corrected pipeline
   - Documented 29 features, 3-phase training approach, risk mitigation

2. **Configuration** (complete)
   - Added xgboost_params to `config/config_retrieval.yaml`
   - Updated `core/config.py` with xgboost_params loading
   - Added ML dependencies to `requirements.txt`

3. **Architecture** (finalized)
   - Pipeline order: LLM → XGBoost → MMR
   - XGBoost uses LLM scores as features (features 22-27)
   - Shadow mode for Phase A/B validation

**Next Steps**:
- Implement feature engineering module
- Implement XGBoost ranker module
- Implement training pipeline
- Integration and unit tests

   - Added result_clicked to batch handler
   - Fixed Decimal JSON serialization
   - Batch analytics endpoint operational

5. **Parent Query ID Linking** (commit: 64be933)
   - Links generate requests to summarize requests
   - Dashboard filters to show parent queries only
   - Eliminates data noise from duplicate entries
   - Cost column removed (FinOps separate from ML ranking)

6. **Debug Cleanup** (commit: 7cf85a8)
   - Removed all console print statements
   - Clean production logs
   - Improved debugging workflow

**Key Metrics**:
- 6 major commits pushed
- 0 known bugs remaining

## Performance Metrics

### Current Baseline
- Cost: $1.20 per query
- Latency: 15-25 seconds
- Accuracy: LLM-based (inconsistent)

### Week 3 Target (BM25 + MMR)
- Cost: $0.70 per query (40% reduction)
- Latency: 8-12 seconds (40% reduction)
- Accuracy: More consistent

### Week 8 Target (+ XGBoost)
- Cost: $0.15 per query (88% total reduction)
- Latency: 3-5 seconds (75% total reduction)
- Accuracy: +15-25% improvement

## Bug Fixes (Recent)

### Foreign Key Constraint Violations (RESOLVED)
- ✅ Async queue race condition → Made log_query_start() synchronous
- ✅ Cache early return → Moved analytics before cache check
- ✅ Missing parent_query_id column → Manual ALTER TABLE
- ✅ UUID suffix inconsistency → Changed to simple timestamp format

### Click Tracking Issues (RESOLVED)
- ✅ Multi-click support → Added auxclick and contextmenu listeners
- ✅ Batch handler missing clicks → Added result_clicked case
- ✅ Decimal serialization → Convert to float for JSON
