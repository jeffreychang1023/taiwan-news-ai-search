# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

MOST IMPORTANT GUIDELINE: Only implement exactly what you have been asked to. Do not add additional functionality. You tend to over complicate.

## Project Overview

NLWeb is a conversational interface platform that enables natural language interactions with websites. It leverages Schema.org markup and supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) for AI agent interactions.

## Common Development Commands

### Running the Server
```bash
# Start aiohttp server (recommended)
./startup_aiohttp.sh

# Or directly from code/python
cd code/python
python -m webserver.aiohttp_server
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Quick test suite (from code directory)
cd code
./python/testing/run_all_tests.sh

# Comprehensive test runner with options
./python/testing/run_tests_comprehensive.sh -m end_to_end  # Specific test type
./python/testing/run_tests_comprehensive.sh --quick        # Quick smoke tests

# Run specific Python tests
cd code/python
python -m pytest testing/ -v

# Single test execution
python -m testing.run_tests --single --type end_to_end --query "test query"
```

### Linting and Type Checking
```bash
# No standard lint/typecheck commands found in codebase
# Suggest adding these to the project if needed
```

## Architecture Overview

### Backend Architecture (code/python/)

**Core Flow**: Query → Pre-retrieval Analysis → Tool Selection → Retrieval (with BM25) → Ranking → Response Generation

1. **Entry Point**: `webserver/aiohttp_server.py` - Async HTTP server handling REST API and WebSocket connections

2. **Request Processing Pipeline**:
   - `core/baseHandler.py` - Main request handler orchestrating the flow
   - `pre_retrieval/` - Query analysis, decontextualization, relevance detection
   - `methods/` - Tool implementations (search, item details, ensemble queries)
   - `retrieval/` - Vector database clients (Qdrant, Azure AI Search, Milvus, Snowflake, Elasticsearch)
     - **BM25 Integration**: `core/bm25.py` - Keyword relevance scoring with intent detection
   - `core/ranking.py` - Result scoring and ranking
   - `llm/` - LLM provider integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Azure, etc.)

3. **Chat/Conversation System** (In Development):
   - `chat/websocket.py` - WebSocket connection management
   - `chat/conversation.py` - Conversation orchestration
   - `chat/participants.py` - Participant management (Human, NLWeb agents)
   - `chat/storage.py` - Message persistence interface

4. **Configuration**: YAML files in `config/` directory control all aspects:
   - `config_nlweb.yaml` - Core settings
   - `config_llm.yaml` - LLM provider configuration
   - `config_retrieval.yaml` - Vector database settings
   - `config_webserver.yaml` - Server configuration

### Frontend Architecture (static/)

**Main Components**:
- `fp-chat-interface.js` - Primary chat interface
- `conversation-manager.js` - Conversation state management
- `chat-ui-common.js` - Shared UI components
- `news-search-prototype.html` - The actual frontend
- ES6 modules with clear separation of concerns

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Streaming Responses**: SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time AI responses
2. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple pre-retrieval checks run concurrently
3. **Fast Track Path**: Optimized path for simple queries
4. **Wrapper Pattern**: NLWebParticipant wraps existing handlers without modification
5. **Cache-First**: Memory cache for active conversations

## Important Implementation Details

### Message Flow
1. User query arrives via WebSocket/HTTP
2. Parallel pre-retrieval analysis (relevance, decontextualization, memory)
3. Tool selection based on tools.xml manifest
4. Vector database retrieval with hybrid search:
   - Intent detection (EXACT_MATCH, SEMANTIC, or BALANCED)
   - Vector similarity (embedding search)
   - BM25 keyword scoring
   - Combined score: α * vector_score + β * bm25_score (α/β adjusted by intent)
5. LLM-based ranking and snippet generation
6. Optional post-processing (summarization, generation)
7. Streaming response back to client

### Error Handling
- HTTP status codes: 429 (queue full), 401 (unauthorized), 400 (bad request), 500 (storage failure with retry)
- Extensive retry logic throughout the system
- Clear error messages in response payloads

### Performance Optimizations
- Direct routing for 2-participant conversations
- In-memory caching for recent messages
- Fast track for simple queries
- Minimal context inclusion (last 5 human messages)

## Testing Strategy

The testing framework (`code/python/testing/`) supports three test types:
- **end_to_end**: Full pipeline testing
- **site_retrieval**: Site discovery testing
- **query_retrieval**: Vector search testing

Test files use JSON format with test_type field and type-specific parameters.

## Current Development Focus

The codebase is on the `conversation-api-implementation` branch, focusing on:
- WebSocket-based real-time conversations
- Multi-participant support
- Message persistence and retrieval
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing NLWebHandler

## Algorithm Documentation Practice

**IMPORTANT**: When implementing or modifying search/ranking algorithms, ALWAYS document in the `algo/` directory.

### Documentation Requirements

1. **Create/Update Algorithm Documentation** (`algo/{ALGORITHM_NAME}_implementation.md`):
   - Algorithm purpose and overview
   - Mathematical formulas and parameters
   - Implementation details (tokenization, scoring, integration points)
   - Code structure and file locations
   - Testing strategy
   - Performance metrics and expected impact
   - Rollback plan

2. **When to Document**:
   - Before implementing a new algorithm
   - When modifying existing algorithm parameters
   - When changing integration points or data flow
   - After A/B testing results (update with findings)

3. **Examples of Algorithms to Document**:
   - BM25 (keyword relevance) ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Week 1-2)
   - MMR (diversity re-ranking) ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Week 1-2)
   - Intent detection (query classification for α/β and λ adjustment) ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Week 1-2)
   - XGBoost (machine learning ranking) - Week 4+
   - Temporal boosting (recency scoring) - Partially implemented
   - Vector similarity (embedding-based) - Existing

### File Naming Convention

```
algo/
  BM25_implementation.md          # Keyword relevance algorithm
  MMR_implementation.md           # Diversity re-ranking
  XGBoost_implementation.md       # ML ranking model
  temporal_boosting.md            # Time decay functions
  hybrid_scoring.md               # Score combination strategies
```

## Notes for Development

- Always check existing patterns in neighboring files before implementing new features
- The system makes 50+ LLM calls per query - optimize carefully
- Results are guaranteed to come from the database (no hallucination in list mode)
- Frontend and backend are designed to be independently deployable
- Configuration changes require server restart
- **Algorithm changes require documentation in `algo/` directory** (see Algorithm Documentation Practice above)

## Docker Deployment Best Practices

### Python Version Compatibility

**Critical Lesson from Production (2025-01-20)**: Dockerfile used Python 3.13, causing production failure.

**Issue**: Python 3.13 is too new for many ML/data libraries:
- `qdrant-client` installs but `AsyncQdrantClient` is **missing methods** (e.g., `search()`)
- Other async libraries may have similar incomplete implementations
- Local development may use different Python version → issue only appears in production

**Solution**:
1. **Use Python 3.11 for production** - mature, stable, broad library support
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.11-slim AS builder
   FROM python:3.11-slim
   COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages ...
   ```

2. **Pin critical dependencies** - avoid surprises from bleeding-edge versions
   ```
   qdrant-client==1.11.3  # Specific version known to work
   ```

3. **Add runtime diagnostics** - verify environment at startup
   ```python
   # At module load time:
   logger.critical(f"🐍 PYTHON VERSION: {sys.version}")
   logger.critical(f"🔍 MODULE HAS method: {'method' in dir(Module)}")
   ```

4. **Clear Docker build cache** when changing base images
   - Render: "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"
   - Otherwise old cached layers persist

### Debugging Docker Deployment Failures

When production fails but local works:
1. **Check Python version first** - most common cause of "missing method" errors
2. **Check Docker build logs** - verify correct base image used
3. **Add diagnostic logging** - log versions and available methods at startup
4. **Clear build cache** - force complete rebuild
5. **Check for multiple processes** - old processes may still be running

**Red Flags**:
- Error: `'ClassName' object has no attribute 'method_name'`
- Library imports but class is incomplete
- Works locally but fails in Docker
- → Likely Python version incompatibility
